# Rock-Paper-Scissor
Let's play the simplest game we all have learnt in our childhood! Rock, Paper and Scissor!

**Rules are pretty clear, and yet let me show.**
- Rock < Paper & Rock > Scissor
- Paper > Rock & Paper < Scissor
- Scissor > Paper & Scissor < Rock

❄ **How to use:**
- Download the code. 
- Run the file using any editor (Command prompt may work, too.)
- Input "r" if you wish to draw a Rock towards your opponent, "p" for paper and "s" for scissor.
- Quit the game by inputting "q" instead of the remaining three.

Let's hope you'll enjoy :)
